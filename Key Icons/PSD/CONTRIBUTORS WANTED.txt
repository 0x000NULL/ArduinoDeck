CONTRIBUTORS WANTED!
-------------------------

Thanks for downloading! 

The purpose of creating this pack is to fill the gaps for those using Elgato's Stream Deck. Some of us are lucky to have the software and know-how to make our own icons and if you're one of them, I'd love for you to contribute to this pack. 

Included here is a PSD file with the recommended color schemes and sizing to fit within the existing icons. These are not hard and fast rules, merely a guide - use your judgement. If you create a set of icons that you would like to share with the world, please create it within this format and send the PSD file to flisky@gmail.com 

Include your website, Twitch or Twitter handle (just one of these please). You will be credited on my site www.twitchtemple.com

Thanks!
